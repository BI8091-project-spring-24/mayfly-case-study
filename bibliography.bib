	abstract = {1. Determined by landscape structure as well as dispersal-related traits of species, connectivity influences various key aspects of population biology, ranging from population persistence to genetic structure and diversity. Here, we investigated differences in small-scale connectivity in terms of gene flow between populations of two ecologically important invertebrates with contrasting dispersal-related traits: an amphipod (Gammarus fossarum) with a purely aquatic life cycle and a mayfly (Baetis rhodani) with a terrestrial adult stage. 2. We used highly polymorphic markers to estimate genetic differentiation between populations of both species within a Swiss pre-alpine catchment and compared these results to the broader-scale genetic structure within the Rhine drainage. Landscape genetic approaches were used to test for correlations of genetic and geographical structures and in-stream barrier effects. 3. We found overall very weak genetic structure in populations of B. rhodani. In contrast, G. fossarum showed strong genetic differentiation, even at spatial scales of a few kilometres, and a clear pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic diversity decreased from downstream towards upstream populations of G. fossarum, suggesting asymmetric gene flow. Correlation of genetic structure with landscape topography was more pronounced in the amphipod. Our study also indicates that G. fossarum might be capable of dispersing overland in headwater regions and of crossing small in-stream barriers. 4. We speculate that differences in dispersal capacity but also habitat specialisation and potentially the extent of local adaptation could be responsible for the differences in genetic differentiation found between the two species. These results highlight the importance of taking into account dispersal-related traits when planning management and conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Temporal and spatial occurrence and upstream flight of lotic mayflies and caddisflies were studied by means of kick netting, slit traps and floating emergence traps in Lake Konnevesi and its outlet stream (Siikakoski), mainly in 1983. Twenty species of mayflies and 78 species of caddisflies were recorded. Clearly lotic mayflies in the material were Baetis subalpinus, Heptagenia sulphurea and Ephemerella mucronata, which occurred only in the stream samples. Females of lotic Baetis rhodani had a long distance upstream flight in the area and occurred frequently in the floating emergence traps especially in sandy littoral habitats of L. Konnevesi. Procloeon bifidum and Nixe joernensis, which in some regions occur mainly in streams, were frequently found in the stony littoral belt of L. Konnevesi. Most of the mayflies recorded in the area were univoltine, but Baetis rhodani and Centroptilum luteolum at least had two generations in 1983. Strictly lotic species among caddisflies were Ceratopsyche nevae, Hydropsyche saxonica, Halesus digitatus, Ceraclea perplexa, Ylodes detruncatus, Athripsodes commutatus and Hydroptila forcipata. These were mainly found in stream samples. A short distance upstream flight of females (c. 0.1-0.4 km) was observed in the populations of H. siltalai, Psychomyia pusilla and Oxyethira frici and a moderate distance flight (at least 0.6 km) by females of Hydropsyche pellucidula, Cheumatopsyche lepida and Polycentropus irroratus. The most abundant caddisflies of the stream Siikakoski (Brachycentrus subnubilus, Neureclipsis bimaculata, Rhyacophila nubila, Agapetus ochripes, Micrasema setiferum and Hydroptila cornuta) were frequently found also in floating emergence traps in the lake (3. 7 km from the rapids). Females of Brachycentrus, Neureclipsis and Rhyacophila favoured traps on sandy substrata while females of Hydroptila were usually found in the stony belt. In the trap material of Agapetus ochripes, males were more abundant than females. According to emergence data, all caddisflies recorded in the area were univoltine though the emerging period of several species such as Rhyacophila nubila and Neureclipsis bimaculata was long. Maximum emergence was observed in early June when brachycentrids were swarming and another peak in August when limnephilids and leptocerids were abundant.},

	abstract = {Ecological data are being collected at a large scale from a multitude of different sources, each with their own sampling protocols and assumptions. As a result, the integration of disparate datasets is a rapidly growing area in quantitative ecology, and is subsequently becoming a major asset in understanding the shifts and trends in species' distributions. However, the tools and software available to construct statistical models to integrate these disparate datasets into a unified framework is lacking. This has made these methods inaccessible to general practitioners and has stagnated the growth of data integration in more applied settings. We therefore present PointedSDMs: an easy to use R package used to construct integrated species distribution models. It provides functions to easily format the data, fit the models in a computationally efficient way and presents the output in a format that is convenient for additional work. This paper illustrates the different uses and functions available in the package, which are designed to simplify the modelling of integrated models. A case study using the package is also presented: combining three datasets coming from different sampling protocols, all containing records of Setophaga caerulescens across Pennsylvania state.},

	abstract = {The species composition of a community is driven by the dispersal capacity of the species forming that community and their ecological niche. While the ecological niches of EPTs (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) are well-studied due to their wide use as indicators for the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems, their dispersal capacity has not yet been accurately characterized. Dispersion of the merolimnic EPT species during the terrestrial aerial adult stage is of special importance because the distance dispersed by active flight or passive wind drift is usually much larger compared to dispersion during the aquatic larval stage by active crawling or by drifting downstream. The aerial dispersal distance has been directly measured for only a small number of EPT species. For most other species, the dispersal capacity is assessed indirectly using species’ traits that are mainly based on expert judgement and dispersal indices derived from trait information. In this study, we compiled a database of European EPTs’ aerial dispersal distances reported in empirical studies and compared them to the dispersal capacity of the species as described by five different dispersal indices (original and modified versions of Li’s Dispersal Capacity Metric DCM and Sarremejane’s Species Flying Propensity SFP as well as relative wing length). The database included empirical data on 180 species, comprising 9.3\% of European EPT species. Most data came from trap experiments with traps located at different distances from the assumed emergence point. Since the distance classes differed between studies and had to be translated to a fixed set of four distance classes here, several species had to be assigned to more than one class. To account for this uncertainty, five ordered logistic regression models, each one with a dispersal index as predictor and the ordinal-scaled aerial dispersal distance as response, were bootstrapped 10,000 times. In each run, species belonging to several distance classes were randomly assigned to a single class out of all possible classes. Since wing length had no significant effect on aerial dispersal distance in any of the 10,000 bootstrap runs, we question the use of this anatomical trait as an indicator for the aerial dispersal capacity. In contrast, a modified version of the DCM index was consistently related to the aerial dispersal distances (96\%). The original SFP index had a significant effect in 100\% of the model runs, indicating that this index is very well-suited as an indicator for the aerial dispersal capacity of European EPT species. This study facilitates the assessment of European EPT flying distances by providing a compilation of empirical data on the topic and by recommending an accurate indirect method when empirical data is not available.},
